# 👋 Hi, I’m Johny

Cloud & Cybersecurity Engineer focused on Python automation and app development for SOC and cloud security.  
I build and document hands-on labs across AWS, Azure, and hybrid environments, integrating security monitoring, detection, and automated response workflows.

## 📂 Featured Projects

- [**Market Deviation Tracker**](https://github.com/johnylabs/Market-Deviation-Tracker)  
  Quantitative analysis tool that tracks grocery price movements, detects deviations from normal ranges, and highlights opportunities where consumers can exploit pricing inefficiencies.

- [**SOC Incident Reports**](https://github.com/johnylabs/incident-reports)  
  Simulated SOC case studies built on top of Wazuh and Suricata, including incident timelines, detection logic, and response runbooks for analyst training.

- [**LUX Core**](https://github.com/johnylabs/lux-core)  
  Experiments with ethical, offline LLMs for secure local deployment, focusing on SOC-assistant style workflows and keeping security data off third-party clouds.

## 🚀 Current Focus & What I’m Building

- Expanding my **SOC home lab** (Wazuh SIEM, Suricata IDS, Pi-hole DNS filtering) to simulate real-world detection and response scenarios.  
- Developing **Python automation pipelines** for log parsing, anomaly detection, alert enrichment, and ticket creation.  
- Building **small cloud apps on AWS/Azure** (APIs and dashboards) that automate SOC workflows and security reporting.  
- Shipping **AI-driven tools** (including Hugging Face Spaces) that turn security runbooks and logs into actionable guidance for analysts.  
- Preparing for advanced certifications (**CISSP**, **PenTest+**, **CASP+**) through hands-on labs, incident simulations, and automation projects.
