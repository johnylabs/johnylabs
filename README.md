# 👋 Hi, I’m Johny

Cloud & Cybersecurity Engineer focused on SOC operations, cloud infrastructure, and automation.  
I build and document hands-on labs across AWS, Azure, and hybrid environments, integrating security monitoring, detection, and automated response workflows.

## 📂 Featured Projects

- [**Market Deviation Tracker**](https://github.com/johnylabs/Market-Deviation-Tracker)  
  Quantitative analysis tool that tracks grocery price movements, identifies deviations from normal ranges, and visualizes opportunities where consumers can exploit pricing inefficiencies.

- [**SOC Incident Reports**](https://github.com/johnylabs/incident-reports)  
  Simulated SOC case studies backed by Wazuh and Suricata data, including incident timelines, detection logic, and response runbooks for analysts.

- [**LLM Research**](https://github.com/johnylabs/llm-research)  
  Experiments with ethical, offline AI for secure local deployment, focused on SOC-assistant style workflows and model isolation from cloud services.

## 🚀 Current Focus

- Expanding my **SOC home lab** with Wazuh SIEM, Suricata IDS, and Pi-hole DNS filtering to simulate real-world detection and response scenarios.  
- Developing **Python automation pipelines** for log parsing, anomaly detection, alert enrichment, and ticket creation.  
- Hardening **AWS + Azure hybrid security workflows**, including logging, identity, and network controls across both clouds.  
- Preparing for advanced certifications (**CISSP**, **PenTest+**, **CASP+**) through hands-on labs and incident simulations.  
- Prototyping **offensive and defensive cybersecurity automation** to reduce mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR).
