# 👋 Hi, I’m Dedan!

**Security Analyst (SOC / IR)** on the **SOC Analyst (Level 1) → SOC Analyst (Level 2) → Incident Response** path.  
Focused on **detection, investigation, response, automation, and vulnerability-driven risk reduction** across SOC and cloud environments.

I build and document hands-on labs across AWS, Azure, and hybrid on-prem environments, integrating security monitoring, detection logic, and automated response workflows.  
My work is **defensive and operational**, focused on making security teams faster, more accurate, and more reliable.

---

## 🎯 Career Path

**SOC Analyst (Level 1) → SOC Analyst (Level 2) → Incident Response**

All labs, incident reports, and automation projects are designed to reflect real SOC responsibilities across this progression:
- Alert triage and escalation  
- Threat hunting and investigation  
- Incident response workflows  
- Detection engineering and automation  
- SecOps-level documentation and process improvement

## 🧠 Representative SOC Case Study (How I Work)

**Scenario:** IDS + SIEM alert indicating possible SSH brute force  

**Process:**
1. Alert ingestion from Suricata → Wazuh → Splunk  
2. Event normalization and enrichment (IP reputation, frequency, asset context)  
3. Investigation using correlated DNS, auth, and network logs  
4. MITRE ATT&CK mapping and severity classification  
5. Response decision (block, monitor, or escalate)  
6. Incident write-up with timeline, evidence, and lessons learned  

**Evidence:**
- Detection rules: `/threat-hunting/rules/`
- Correlated events: `/incident-reports/`
- Automation logic: `/soc-alert-automation/`
- SIEM queries & enrichment logic: `/soc-alert-automation/`

This same workflow underpins my labs, automation pipelines, and incident reports.

## ⭐ SOC Core Workflow (Start Here)

If you want to see how I actually work as an analyst:

1. **Alert ingestion & normalization** → [SOC Alert Automation](https://github.com/johnylabs/soc-alert-automation)  
2. **Investigation & escalation** → [Incident Reports](https://github.com/johnylabs/incident-reports)  
3. **Detection improvement & hunting** → [Threat Hunting Lab](https://github.com/johnylabs/threat-hunting)

## 🧱 Upstream Security Inputs (Prevention → Better Detection)

My SOC work is informed by upstream security data that improves alert quality and prioritization:

- Vulnerability scanning and exposure analysis (Tenable Nessus)
- Asset context and configuration state
- Patch status and known exploitability
- Mapping vulnerabilities to potential detection gaps

This allows me to:
- Prioritize alerts based on real exposure
- Reduce false positives caused by known misconfigurations
- Align detections with actual attack paths
