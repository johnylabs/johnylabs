# 👋 Hi, I’m Johny

Cloud & Cybersecurity Engineer focused on SOC operations, cloud infrastructure, and Python/LLM automation.  
I build and document hands-on labs across AWS, Azure, and hybrid on-prem environments — integrating security monitoring, detection, and automated response workflows.

## 📂 Featured Projects

- [**Market Deviation Tracker**](https://github.com/johnylabs/Market-Deviation-Tracker)  
  Quantitative analysis tool that tracks grocery price movements, detects deviations from normal ranges, and highlights opportunities where consumers can exploit pricing inefficiencies.

- [**SOC Alert Automation**](https://github.com/johnylabs/soc-alert-automation)  
  Python pipeline that ingests Wazuh/Suricata alerts, normalizes events, enriches with context, and sends notifications to chat (Discord/Slack-style) for fast analyst triage.

- [**Threat Hunting Lab**](https://github.com/johnylabs/threat-hunting)  
  Hypothesis-driven hunts across Wazuh, Suricata, and cloud logs — with hunts, Sigma/Wazuh rules, and Jupyter notebooks for DNS tunneling, SSH brute force, and cloud anomalies.

- [**Incident Reports**](https://github.com/johnylabs/incident-reports)  
  Structured SOC incident write-ups with timelines, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, evidence, and lessons learned — written as if for a real SOC manager or client.

- [**AI SOC Runbook QA**](https://github.com/johnylabs/ai-soc-runbook-qa)  
  LLM-based assistant that reads SOC runbooks and incidents, then answers analyst questions and suggests response steps. Designed for offline / lab use first.

- [**ES AI Immersion Lab**](https://github.com/johnylabs/es-ai-immersion-lab)  
  Spanish learning lab using local and hosted LLMs to run structured conversation practice, correction, and vocab drills — built for daily Spanish immersion.

## 🧩 ThreadBlue Collaborative Projects

- [**soc-lab-projects**](https://github.com/thread-blue/soc-lab-projects)  
  Full SOC lab integrating Splunk, Wazuh (SIEM), Suricata IDS, and DNS filtering. Built for alerting, correlation, and end-to-end security automation.

- [**cybersecurity-scripts**](https://github.com/thread-blue/cybersecurity-scripts)  
  Python utilities for log parsing, enrichment, threat detection, and SOC automation — developed and tested against the ThreadBlue SOC Lab.

## 🚀 Current Focus & What I’m Building

- Expanding my **SOC home lab** (Wazuh SIEM, Suricata IDS, Pi-hole DNS filtering, pfSense/Proxmox) to simulate real-world detection and response scenarios.  
- Developing **Python automation pipelines** for log parsing, anomaly detection, alert enrichment, and ticket/workflow creation.  
- Building **small cloud apps on AWS/Azure** (APIs, dashboards, and automation scripts) that tie together SOC tooling and cloud security controls.  
- Shipping **AI-driven tools** (local 3090 LLM gateway + Hugging Face Spaces) that turn runbooks, hunts, and incident reports into actionable guidance for analysts.  
- Using the **ES AI Immersion Lab** to push toward fluent Spanish through daily AI-powered conversation practice.  
- Preparing for advanced certifications (**CISSP track**, **PenTest+**, **CASP+**) through hands-on labs, incident simulations, and automation projects.
